<p title="tooltip">There once was a house that contained four lazy, whiny, and fluffy moochers. Their names were as follows - Echo, Sookie, Holly and Sigrid. Sookie, the oldest is ten and is a cranky motorboat of purrs for anything youre eating and also loves warm snuggles under covers. Echo is the biggest, he is 8 and he is the loudest and demands attention twenty four seven like a toddler for pets and must be nearby at all times like a duckling. Sigrid is the runt but she demands ownership over the top peak of all four cat condos to compensate her short stature. She only drinks from faucets and will demand pets with light baps. Last Holly is the baby, she always has pure black eyes full of wonder and innocense and she just wants to be friends with everyone.</p>
